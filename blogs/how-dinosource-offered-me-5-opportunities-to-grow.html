            Dinosource helps students to establish their personal skills by providing them with
            <span>opportunities</span> to take on new challenges and <span>responsibilities</span>. In a <span>team
                setting</span>, members are given the chance to lead projects or take on tasks that are outside of their
            comfort zone. This can help them develop their <span>problem-solving</span> skills, as well as their ability
            to think on their feet and handle pressure.

                        Dinosource is a <span>design and development agency</span>
                    </a>
                    run by students who create digital
                    experiences for brands. As young, ambitious individuals with a passion for design and development,
                    these <span>students</span> bring a fresh perspective and energy to their work. They are able to
                    think outside the box and come up with <span>innovative solutions</span> that are engaging and
                    effective.

                <p class="project__description">
                    Dinosource partners with companies and organisations, which means that members get the chance to
                    work on projects that are <span>relevant and meaningful</span> . I considered this a great way to
                    gain practical <span>experience</span> and develop my skills in a <span>real-world
                        environment</span>.

                <h2 class="subtitle">The real deal</h2>
                <p class="project__description">
                    While working with real clients, we are exposed to challenges and expectations that we often do not
                    encounter in a traditional classroom environment. This can lead us to see the <span>relevance of our
                        courses</span> and understand how our education can be used to make a difference in the world.
                    Moreover, it can help us <span>build our professional network</span>.

                    Personally, I notice that my design and development skills have been strengthened by this
                    experience. In addition, it is clear that I work in a more <span>structured</span> way. But the
                    biggest improvement I see is in my <span>communication and feedback skills</span>, which have
                    become much stronger.

                <p class="project__description">
                    Meanwhile, this is my 4th month at Dinosource and I notice that I'm flourishing. It is a gradual but
                    strong maturation that I notice from myself. I feel I am becoming more <span>self-assured</span> and
                    I am standing more firmly in my shoes.

                <p class="project__description">
                    The tasks are <span>tremendously varied</span>, which is very important. Nobody wants a monotonous
                    job with the same assignments every day. You hardly learn anything from that. The more variety in
                    your tasks, the more confirmation you get that you are actually contributing something.

                <p class="project__description">
                    Overall, my time in Dinosource has been incredibly <span>valuable for my personal growth</span>. By
                    collaborating with others and taking on new challenges, I have gained valuable experience and
                    developed new skills that will serve me well in my future career. If I can do it, surely you can
